# Hello World!

In this section, I have put my small projects.
Many of these projects can be found on the internet, but I have written them in my own way

I hope they were helpful.

## ðŸ§® Python Calculator Project

This Python calculator project is designed to effortlessly handle your basic arithmetic operations. By utilizing symbols such as '+', '-', 'x' (or '*'), and '/' (or 'Ã·'), users can input mathematical expressions and receive quick and accurate results. The program parses the input, extracts the numbers and the operation, and performs the calculation. With error handling in place, it ensures a smooth user experience. Explore the world of Python programming with this handy calculator! ðŸš€
> **Input:**
```console
foo@bar:~$ python calculator.py What do you want to solve? 3+3

```
>

> **Output:**
```console
foo@bar:~$ python calculator.py 3+3=6

```

## ðŸ“§ Python Email Sender

This Python script simplifies email sending through the smtplib library and the SMTP protocol. It begins by configuring the SMTP server, setting up email content, and creating both plain text and HTML message bodies. The process involves connecting to the server, initiating a secure connection, logging in, and ultimately sending the email from the sender to the recipient. Upon successful transmission, the script gracefully closes the SMTP connection and prints a confirmation message. Customize sender and recipient addresses, adjust content, and streamline your communication workflow effortlessly with this Python email sender script. ðŸš€
> **Input:**
```console
foo@bar:~$ python email_sender.py Type your password and press enter: ********

```
>

> **Output:**
```console
foo@bar:~$ python email_sender.py Email sent successfully!

```
